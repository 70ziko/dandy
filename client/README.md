To run this script in the browser locally, you need to set up a development environment. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm (Node Package Manager).

2. **Start the development server**: Run the following command to start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

3. **Open the browser**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see your `CardGame` component running.
